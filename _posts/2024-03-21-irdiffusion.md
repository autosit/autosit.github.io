title: Stable diffusion infrared texturing
category: LTP
---


## Background

Stable diffusion is a deep generative artificial neural network that can be used to generate images from text input. 
It can also be used generate textures for 3-dimensional models. 
In contrast to previous text-to-image models it is open source and can be run on consumer-grade computers. 



## Scope

The goal of this project is to simulate infrared textures for the digital twin Autoferry Gemini, which is used for simulations of the autonomous ferries milliAmpere 1 and milliAmpere 2. 

## Proposed tasks for the specialization project

* Make yourself familiar with latent diffusion models in general and Stable Diffusion in particular.
* Consolidate suitable infrared training data for experimenting with Stable Diffusion in the context of Autoferry Gemini. 
* Train Stable Diffusion on collected data, and generate high-fidelity simulations. 
* Analyze the output in quantitative and qualitative terms. 

## Proposed tasks for the MSc thesis 

The MSc thesis will build on the specialization project, and pursue a topic such as one of the following in greater depth:

* Can simulated infrared textures be used to train infrared detectors?
* Can simulated infrared textures be used to test infrared detectors?


## Prerequisites
This is a list of *recommended* prerequisites for this master project.

- Strong programming skills in either Matlab, Python or C++. 
- You should have had courses in machine learning and/or computer vision.
